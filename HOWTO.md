## Linking to other problems

Including the problem number (together with the "prob" prefix) inside curly brackets creates a link to the given problem.
The text of the hyperlink will be the full name of the problem.

For example, writing `{prob006}` inside a specification file ("specification.md") will create a link with the hyperlink text "Golomb rulers".
