The Costas Arrays Problem seems to not benefit from constraint propagation very much.
[These slides](http://4c.ucc.ie/~hsimonis/ELearning/costas/slides.pdf) by Helmut Simonis have a good demonstration of limits of propagation when solving it, some improvements over a naive model via adding implied constraints and trying a better search strategy.
Don't be scared of the 877 slides, the slide deck contains some very nice animations of the propagation and search behaviour of 3 variants of the model and search strategies.

[This website](http://datagenetics.com/blog/february22013) maintains a list of known results.

A paper by Drakakis et. al. cite{drakakis2011results} presents a study where the authors spend 366 machine years on the order 29 problem and do not find anything new.
