This is a generalisation of the {prob030} proposed by [Marco Chiarandini, Luca Di Gaspero, Stefano Gualandi, and Andrea Schaerf at University of Udine](http://satt.diegm.uniud.it/).

With respect to the BACP, the GBACP adds:

* several curricula that can share courses
* soft constraints, in particular for teacher preferences for not teaching during some terms.

The detailed description, data, best results, and a solution validator can be found at <http://satt.diegm.uniud.it/projects/gbac/>.
