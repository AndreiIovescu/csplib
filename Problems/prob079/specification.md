Overview
========

The {prob054} Problem, [prob054], suffers from the problem that its complexity is trivial as a decision problem.  
The n-Queens Completion and Blocked n-Queens problems are variants of {prob054} which have been proven to
be NP-Complete as decision problems and #P-Complete as counting problems.
